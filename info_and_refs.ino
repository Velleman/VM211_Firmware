  Get basic environmental readings from the BME280
  This example shows how to read humidity, pressure, and current temperature from the BME280 over I2C.

  Hardware connections:
  BME280 -> Arduino
  GND -> GND
  3.3 -> 3.3
  SDA -> A4 (UNO)
  SCL -> A5 (UNO)

  Read the TVOC and CO2 values from the SparkFun CSS811 breakout board
  A new sensor requires at 48-burn in. Once burned in a sensor requires
  20 minutes of run in before readings are considered good.

  Hardware Connections (Breakoutboard to Arduino):
  3.3V to 3.3V pin
  GND to GND pin
  SDA to A4 (UNO)
  SCL to A5 (UNO)

  -> we use shield, so modify the library!!!

  This example demonstrates how to detect lightning! It has a few basic
  settings to help with rejecting noise or "disturbers" (false lightning events). 
  It uses the onboard interrupt hardware pin, so in addition to attaching to
  it data lines you'll need to connnect to the interrupt pin labled "INT". 

  Hardware connections:
  AS3935 -> Arduino
  GND -> GND
  VCC -> 5V
  SDA -> A4 (UNO)
  SCL -> A5 (UNO)
  IRQ -> 2 (UNO)
  
  -------------------------------
  Speaker:  - to GND
            + to A10
            
  -------------------------------
  Optional RGB LED:       - to GND (or A11 on mega sensor shield)
                          G to A12
                          R to A13
                          B to A14

  SD card datalogger on TFT shield on Arduino Mega
  Based on the example by Tom Igoe - 9 Apr 2012
  This example shows how to log data from three analog sensors (A11 -> A14) to an SD card using the SD library.
   
 The circuit:
 ** Mega:  MOSI - pin 51, MISO - pin 50, CLK - pin 52, CS - pin 4 (CS pin can be changed)
  and pin #52 (SS) must be an output
 => because we are using an TFT shield with SD card, some modifications needs to be done in the libary
 1. Download the SD Adafruit library from https://github.com/adafruit/SD and replace the file in your library 
 2. comment out #define USE_SPI_LIB from both Sd2Card.h and Sd2Card.cpp. 
 3. Modify Sd2Card.h to enable the softSPI for Mega 2560 by modifying this line: #define MEGA_SOFT_SPI 1  //change it to non-zero from 0
